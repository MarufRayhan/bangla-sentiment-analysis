# Bangla Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of deep learning models for detecting emotions from Bangla text. The project utilizes Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and CNN-BiLSTM models to classify text into various emotional categories.

## Dataset
The models are trained on a Bangla text dataset, translated from English, encompassing six emotions.

## Usage
Run the main script to train or test the models.


## Models
- **CNN-BiLSTM**: Combines Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory.
- **BiGRU**: Utilizes Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit.

## Performance
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The detailed performance metrics are available in the results section.
